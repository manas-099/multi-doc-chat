What major trends were observed in large language model (LLM) development between 2024 and 2025?,"The 2024–2025 period saw major LLM releases like Meta’s Llama 4 family with multimodal and mixture-of-experts features, Google’s Gemini 2.5 and Gemma models with strong on-device capabilities, and continued updates from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others such as GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude 4."
What improvements were made in embedding models during this time?,"OpenAI launched the text-embedding-3 family (small and large), offering better cost-performance for RAG, while Google introduced EmbeddingGemma for efficient on-device semantic search. The ecosystem overall focused on latency, recall metrics, and quantization for production use."
"What is meant by 'agentic AI,' and how did it evolve in 2025?","Agentic AI refers to systems that autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks. In 2025, it became a major industry trend, with vendors releasing SDKs, production toolkits, and enterprise frameworks like Anthropic’s 'Skills' and Salesforce’s Agentforce."
What challenges or cautions were associated with agentic AI adoption?,Analysts warned of 'agent washing'—projects branded as agentic without real value. Gartner predicted over 40% of agentic AI projects might be scrapped by 2027 due to unclear ROI and high engineering costs.
What practical advice does the summary offer to engineers and researchers?,"The document advises selecting model families by task type, benchmarking embeddings for RAG pipelines, using hybrid retrieval for cost efficiency, and defining clear KPIs when building agentic systems to avoid over-generalization and failure."
